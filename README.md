<h1> Efficiency-Fire-Extinguishers</h1>

<h2>Predicting the efficiency of fire extinguishers</h2>
<br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>
<p>The aim of this project is to find a machine learning model to predict extinguisher efficiency
As this is a project involving the safety of people, the target used will be 90% accuracy.
The model will produce a result of one class: fire extinguished or not, so it is a supervised
classification model.
</p>
<p>The technology used was R programming and statistics software.</p>
<p>To open the program, paste this script into your RStudio. Don't forget to configure setwd() with the path to the <strong>.R file</strong>.
