<h1>Efficiency-Fire-Extinguishers</h>

<h2>Predicting the efficiency of fire extinguishers</h2>

<p>The aim of this project is to find a machine learning model to predict extinguisher efficiency<br>
   As this is a project involving the safety of people, the target used will be 90% accuracy.<br>
   The model will produce a result of one class: fire extinguished or not, so it is a supervised <br>
   classification model.
